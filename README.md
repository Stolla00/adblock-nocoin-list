# NoCoin adblock list
This is an adblock list to block browser based crypto mining. Currently only coin-hive is on the list. If you see another website doing this deed, feel free to raise an issue or raise a PR.

# Installation
Make sure you have an adblocker installed that uses Adblock Plus' list (uBlock or AdBlock Plus for example). Then import below link into your adblocker:

# Thanks
This list is basically a copy of [keraf/NoCoin](https://github.com/keraf/NoCoin) but it's as an Adblock list rather than a Chrome plugin. This should be usable by any browser.
